# Background 1: Programming

# Code and 'programming'

When people say `programming`, they are referring to the act of writing computer `code`. Depending on your background, you might see it as just some kind of densely-packed form of written English, or you'd see it as a bunch of buzzwords in clumps. The idea is that code is a sort of language that acts as a comfortable middle-ground between humans and machines. It's easy enough on the eyes for a programmer to read (it's still made of letters, words all nicely spaced over lines), while being strictly regular enough for a computer to interpet as strict instructions.
