# Background
Here you will find some helpful text designed to guide you through some questions you might have. For some more specific questions for Python syntax, you might not find the answers here and should then google it.

The three different kinds of questions you might have are here partitioned into "setup", "conceptual" and "python".

## Setup
If are lost before you even get started, look here for answers. These questions might come up if you don't know how to get your foot in the door. Maybe you know what you want to do, but you just don't know how to do it. Browse these first.

## Conceptual
If you can more or less follow, but find yourself with some conceptual hangup, look here. For example, "what is the difference between X and Y", or maybe "Ok but why would I need X?"


## Python
These are more specific questions. This is a lot more python-centric but designed to help you understand the syntax, or make sense of what tools you have available to you. Look here if you have a rough idea of what you want, but aren't sure how to express it in Python.
