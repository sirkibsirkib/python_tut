# Task 0: Greeter

## Prompt

Write a script that will wait for the user to input their name as a string. Once they have done so, the program will display a custom output to greet the user. For instance, here is an example of a corrext interaction. This is what the user would see on their screen. To make it clear what is INPUT (and not output), input lines are prefixed with `>>>`. This doesn't have to be the case for your program.

```
Please give your name:
$Bob
Welcome to python, Bob!
```

## Intention

This will be your first foray into Pythontown. Here we will just do some basic operations to get you comfortable with python and how to solve problems like this. This little script is intended just to show you the basic structure of such a script and how you can expect everything to work. Your contributions here are minimal.
