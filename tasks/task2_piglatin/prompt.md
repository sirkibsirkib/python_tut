# Task 2: Piglatin

## Prompt

Write a script that will listen for a user's input. The user will give some word. The program would then print the 'pig latin' form of that input.

Pig latin is an operation on a string, whereby the last letter is moved to the front, and the end is appended with '-ay'. More formally, it is given as:

x_1x_2...x_{n-1}x_n => x_nx_1x_2...x_{n-1}ay

## Intention

This will be your first foray into Pythontown. Here we will just do some basic operations to get you comfortable with python and how to solve problems like this. This little script is intended just to show you the basic structure of such a script and how you can expect everything to work. Your contributions here are minimal.
